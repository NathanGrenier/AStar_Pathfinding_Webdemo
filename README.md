# About
A real-time visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm implemented during a 24-hour hackathon. The project demonstrates pathfinding mechanics through an interactive web interface where users can create and modify maze configurations. Built with React and TypeScript, the application provides an educational tool to understand how A* efficiently finds the shortest path while avoiding obstacles.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive grid system allowing users to add/remove walls
- Automatic maze generation with adjustable dimensions
- Real-time visualization of the A* algorithm's exploration process
- Path reconstruction visualization once the target is reached
- Detailed metrics display showing explored nodes, frontier nodes, and time to compute

This project was developed by a team of 2 developers, @NathanGrenier and @NeilTheFisher, in 24 hours as part of Concordia's 2023 hackathon.
